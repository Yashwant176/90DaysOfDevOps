# Day 10 – File Permissions Challenge

## Files Created
- devops.txt
- notes.txt
- script.sh
- project/

## Permission Changes
- script.sh → made executable using chmod +x
- devops.txt → made read-only
- notes.txt → set to 640
- project/ → set to 755

## Commands Used
- touch, echo, cat, vim
- head, tail
- chmod, ls -l, ls -ld

## What I Learned
- How Linux permissions work (rwx)
- How to safely control access to files
- Why execute permission is required for scripts
