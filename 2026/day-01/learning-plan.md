# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## Introduction
I am currently a fresher with a background in Python and web development. I am an apiring Full Stack Pytho Developer, but I am new to DevOps and Cloud technologies.
My understanding of DevOps is that it is a culture and set of practices that helps teams build, test, and deploy software faster and more reliably by combining development and operations. Cloud engineering enables scalable, flexible infrastructure that supports modern applications.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
I am starting my DevOps journey to:
- Bridge the gap between development and deployment
- Learn how real-world production systems are built and managed
- Improve my job readiness as a software/DevOps engineer

DevOps skills are in high demand, and I want to build strong fundamentals that will help me grow long-term in the IT industry.

## Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days
By the end of 90 days, I want to:
1. Deploy a containerized web application on a cloud platform
2. Build and understand a complete CI/CD pipeline
3. Gain confidence in using Linux, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes basics

## Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build
1. Linux fundamentals and troubleshooting
2. CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins
3. Docker and Kubernetes basics for application deployment

## Weekly Time Commitment
- Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day
- Weekends: 4–5 hours per day
- Total: ~18–20 hours per week

## Consistency & Discipline Plan
- I will study DevOps every day, even if it is only for 30 minutes
- I will maintain notes and push all practice work to GitHub
- I will share weekly progress on LinkedIn to stay accountable

Consistency is my top priority over speed or perfection.
